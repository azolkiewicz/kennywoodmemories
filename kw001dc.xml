    <dc:description>For more than a century, Kennywood has been the Pittsburgh area's playground.
        Founded in 1898 at the terminus of the Monongahela Street Railway trolley line, the park
        quickly grew into a favorite summertime destination. Kennywood is unique in that it is one
        of the country's few successful trolley parks. In 1987, Kennywood was designated a National
        Historic Landmark and is known today as America's Finest Traditional Amusement Park. Many
        unique rides and attractions have distinguished Kennywood over the years. Some old
        favorites, such as the Rockets, Laff in the Dark, Ghost Ship, and Skooters, are long gone.
        Others, such as the Old Mill, Noah's Ark, Auto Race, Turtle, Whip, and Grand Carousel, still
        entertain guests today. Kennywood is perhaps best known for its impressive collection of
        roller coasters, from earlier coasters such as the Figure Eight, Speed-O-Plane, and Pippin
        to the Racer, Jack Rabbit, Thunderbolt, and Phantom's Revenge coasters that still thrill
        riders today.</dc:description>
